# DungeonStats
A simple stat roller for D&amp;D

Currently takes 4 random numbers from 1 to 6, selects the largest three, adds them together, and returns that process 6 times. Will add in locking in numbers as well as health rolling.

This application is made using .NET Core 3 with the new Blazor feature, in which the front end scripting is written in C#.
